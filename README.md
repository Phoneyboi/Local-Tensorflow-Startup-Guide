# Local-Tensorflow-Startup-Guide
Personal guide to make sure I remember how to start up Tensorflow on my local machine.

Will need to update regularly for future use cases.

## 1) Launch Anaconda Prompt
## 2) Activate Tensorflow
* In Anaconda Prompt: conda activate tensorflow
## 3) Use cd command to find working directory
* cd name - Goes to 'name' that is in current working directory. 
* cd\ - Goes all the way back in the directory.
* cd.. - Goes back one folder. 
## 4) Launch Jupyter Notebook
* In Anaconda Prompt: jupyter notebook
* This will open up the Jupyter Notebook with an active Tensorflow environment to put work into. 
## 5) Shut down kernel
* Go into the Anaconda Prompt and hit ctrl+c a few times to kill the kernel.
## 6) Deactivate Tensorflow
* In Anaconda Prompt: conda deactivate
* Close Anaconda Prompt
